### About
This is a simple Chrome extension to disable death symbols in the Fandom wiki. Death symbols here currently refer to the dagger symbol (U+2000) or &#8224; that are attached usually as superscripts.

**Disclaimer**: This is NOT a one-size-fits-all extension which hides other statuses like deceased or manipulates wiki entries to hide any indication of death regarding the character of interest OR any other characters mentioned in the wiki.
